# EXP_R47 preregistration

## Hypothesis
Oracle F3 plus strong F2 is sufficient for stable two-step latent execution under teacher-forced feedback.

## New method family
`two_step` with candidates: r8_two_step, graph_two_step, cem_two_step, fixed.

## Frozen components
Representation, decoder, F1, historical F2, and EXP_R8 baseline are frozen.

## Data and split
864 episode-disjoint latent windows: 206 train, 181 development, 477 held-out. Train-only target regions and support are constructed before evaluation.

## Evaluation rule
Select one candidate using development metrics, then open held-out once. Metrics include target arrival, hidden path error, continuity, curvature, support distance, and direction agreement; family-specific F3/prospective metrics are recorded when applicable.

## Success and falsification
A candidate must improve the registered joint gate or pass the family-specific stage threshold. Failure falsifies this mechanism only; it does not erase the language-redirection or action-coordinate claims.
